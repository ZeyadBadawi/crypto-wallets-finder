## Installation

To get started, you need to clone this repository. Use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZeyadBadawi/crypto-wallets-finder.git
```

Next, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd crypto-wallets-finder
```

Install the required dependencies. If you're using Python, you can do this with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once you have installed the project, you can start using it. Here are some basic commands:

### Generating a Mnemonic Seed Phrase

To generate a mnemonic seed phrase, run:

```bash
python generate_mnemonic.py
```

This command will display a secure seed phrase that you can use for your wallet.

### Bruteforcing a Seed Phrase

If you have a partial seed phrase or want to recover a lost wallet, use the bruteforce tool:

```bash
python bruteforce.py --seed <partial_seed>
```

Replace `<partial_seed>` with your actual seed phrase.

### Checking Wallet Balance

To check the balance of a wallet, use:

```bash
python check_balance.py --address <wallet_address>
```

Replace `<wallet_address>` with the actual address you want to check.

## How It Works

### Mnemonic Seed Phrase Generation

The tool uses a secure algorithm to generate a random mnemonic seed phrase. This phrase can then be used to create a wallet that stores your cryptocurrency securely.

### Bruteforce Mechanism

The bruteforce tool attempts various combinations of words to find the correct seed phrase. It uses a dictionary of common words to increase the chances of recovery.

### Balance Checking

The balance checking feature connects to the respective blockchain networks (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain) to retrieve the current balance of the specified wallet address.

## Supported Wallets

- **Bitcoin (BTC)**
- **Ethereum (ETH)**
- **Binance Coin (BNB)**

This project focuses on these three cryptocurrencies, but it can be extended to support more in the future.
